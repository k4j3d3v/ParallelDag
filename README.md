# Parallel DAG Interpreter

A C++ library for parallel execution of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Originally developed for the *"Parallel and Distributed System: Paradigms and Models"* course at the University of Pisa, taught by Prof. M. Danelutto.

## Overview

This library provides a parallel interpreter for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) implemented in C++. It utilizes native thread support for parallel execution. The main goal is to enable efficient parallelization of tasks represented by DAGs.
